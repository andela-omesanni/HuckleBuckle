MY VERSION OF THE POPULAR HUCKLE BUCKLE GAME (THIRD ANDELA PROJECT)


********************************************  DESCRIPTION  ****************************************************

This project was to do my own version of the popular huckle buckle game. You have to guess correctly the number chosen by the
computer by entering a number from 0 to 100. If you are closer to the computer's number, you will get a feedback of hot and 
if farther, you will get a response of cold. When you guess right, you will get the appropriate response.

********************************************  THINGS LEARNT  ***************************************************

I learnt to think out of box as this project involves a lot of logic. I had to think about user experience issues too. For 
example when some enters a number and the computer gives a response, you want the response to at the person's eye level
which is normally up since the person is looking at the screen with their head straight up. I did not want a situation where
the computer gives a response and then the user is always looking down for the response. I also learnt how to use animations to create a visual effect that engages the user, lets the user always know that something is happening and makes the game much appealing.
